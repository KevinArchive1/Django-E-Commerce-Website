        <h1>About Sakura Footwear</h1>
        <p>
            Sakura Footwear was founded with a simple vision: to create shoes that combine comfort, durability, and timeless style. 
            Inspired by the elegance of Japanese cherry blossoms, our name reflects our belief that fashion should be both beautiful 
            and meaningful. Just as sakura blossoms symbolize new beginnings, each pair of our shoes is designed to help you take 
            confident steps into the future.
